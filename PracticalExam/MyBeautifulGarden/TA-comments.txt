Good, O(N^4) algo
You have good command of the language, but you made the solution (code) longer than 
necessary

pre-/post-conds -5
var scope / redundant instance vars -2
  rowCount colCount
modularity -3
  can further abstract some sub-problems and solve them in another method, makes 
your solution easy to understand at one glance, and makes each method cohesive
redundant code -3
  lines 32-34
  lines 58,59 - negate condition and avoid trivial continue block
sloppy control flow -6
  lines 42,43,74-78 - check bounds properly instead of relying on exceptions
  lines 60-73 - use labelled break instead
  (or return k-1, if you implemented finding num of diff square sizes for a given 
start pt to another method)
